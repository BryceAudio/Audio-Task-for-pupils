# Audio Task for pupils


Created in 2016, this ProTools project was created for school aged pupils to use an audio tool for the first time.
Glasgow Caledonian University hosted a day for these pupils, themed around the zombie apocalypse.

This task was one of many and pupils had 20 minutes to complete.
